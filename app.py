st.write("""
         This model is made for students who study 'Linear Programming'. 
        We can solve all kinds of LP problems like feasible, infeasible, unbounded and so on. 
        I'll give you a simple guideline to help your better use.

        1. Upload your LP problem that you cannot solve.
        2. Check the formulation and compare with yours.
        3. Modify your answer and practice.
